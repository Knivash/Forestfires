## Business Scope: Predicting Burned Area of Forest Fires in Northeast Portugal

The goal of this project is to predict the burned area of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal using meteorological and other relevant data. This task has implications in various areas, and its outcomes can contribute to a multitude of sectors and initiatives. Below are some aspects of the business scope:

1. ### **Environmental Monitoring and Early Warning Systems:** Developing accurate predictive models for burned area estimation can facilitate the creation of effective early warning systems. These systems provide timely alerts to authorities and communities, enabling them to prepare for potential fires and mitigate environmental impact and public safety concerns.

2. **Risk Assessment and Management:** Predictive models can assist in assessing fire risk in the northeast region of Portugal based on meteorological and related data. This information aids in allocating firefighting resources, equipment, and supplies to high-risk areas, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of fire management efforts.

3. **Resource Allocation:** Government agencies responsible for firefighting, emergency response, and environmental conservation can benefit from predictive models. These models optimize resource allocation by identifying areas with higher fire probabilities, ultimately enhancing fire management strategies.

4. **Policy Formulation and Land Management:** Insights from predictive models inform policymakers in creating effective land management strategies. Data-driven knowledge about meteorological conditions, land use, and fire occurrence can lead to policies promoting safer land management practices and reducing fire risks.

5. **Research and Collaboration:** Building predictive models necessitates collaboration among experts in meteorology, environmental science, data science, and public safety. This initiative fosters interdisciplinary research, leading to innovative solutions and advancements in fire management strategies.

6. **Insurance and Economic Impact Assessment:** Accurate burned area predictions aid insurance companies in assessing fire-related claims. Furthermore, understanding the economic impact of forest fires on local communities, agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure enables informed decision-making and preparedness.

7. **Public Awareness and Education:** Predictive model outcomes raise public awareness about forest fire risks. Educating residents about fire prevention, safety measures, and emergency response promotes responsible behavior and minimizes fire-related damages.

8. **Data Collection and Infrastructure:** Developing accurate models necessitates robust data collection, storage, and analysis infrastructure. This may involve creating data-gathering mechanisms, quality control processes, and secure storage solutions.

9. **Continuous Improvement and Adaptation:** Predictive models must be continuously refined as new data becomes available and environmental conditions evolve. This establishes a long-term business scope for maintaining and enhancing model accuracy.

In summary, predicting burned areas of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal has broad applications across environmental monitoring, risk assessment, resource allocation, policy formulation, research collaboration, public awareness, and more. The accurate prediction of burned areas contributes to improved preparedness, resource allocation, and management of forest fire-related risks.
